# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

  The purpose of this analysis is to see what factors effect vehicle performance on our cars.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
  
  We looked at 5 factors that may effect the mpg which were Spoiler Angle, vehicle weight, length, ground clearance, and all wheel drive. Based off of our linear model I listed the factors in order of positive correlation 1 being the the most important and 5 the least important
   1. Spoiler Angle
   2. All Wheel Drive
   3. Vehicle Weight
   4. vehicle length
   5. ground clearance

  The slope of our R^2 is positive

##  Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

  Currently Lot 3 does not meet design criteria, it's variance is over 100 psi, however our other two lots are well within the reccommended variance of 100 psi.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
  
The t tests are rather odd, it indicates:


### The Mean of all 3 lots is under 1500
  When looking at the mean PSI agains the mean, it is 1498.78, though under the mean is close and within the 95% confidence interval, with a p value of 0.06, which is over over the usual 0.05. The degrees of freedom is the highes at 149

### Lot 1 is the same as the mean but with a high p value

  Lot 1 has a mean of exactly 1500, though with a p value of 1, and a t value of zero

 ### Lot 2 is roughly the mean
  The t value is 0.5175 which makes lot 2 the 2nd closest to the mean.

 ### Lot 3 is under the mean
  Is certainly under the mean, with its confidence interval under the mean.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

  To look at consumer interest across vehicle manufacturers, I would analyze the revenue produced by each manufacturer by vehicle type. 
  
  Hypotehsis: Certain vehicle types drive sales
  
  Alternative: Hypothesis: Vehicle types don't drive sales
  
  ### How to measure? 
    - number of vehicles sold for each type
    - Revenue gained by vehicle type
    
 ### How to analyze?
    t test, 
      1) For each manufacturer see the difference in means of:
        - sales per vehicle type
        - sales overall by company
        
        Linear Model
       2) Check proportion of vehhicle type sold per company, and see if it is a predictor of sales.
